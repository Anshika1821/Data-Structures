    "# Theory Questions and Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What are data structures, and why are they important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Data structures are organized ways to store, manage, and process data efficiently. They are important because they provide a means to handle large amounts of data systematically, enabling efficient access, modification, and processing of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Mutable data types can be modified after their creation, such as lists and dictionaries. Immutable data types cannot be changed once created, such as strings and tuples. Example: A list can have elements added or removed, but a tuple remains constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable. Lists are better for operations requiring frequent changes, whereas tuples are more suited for data integrity where modifications are not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Describe how dictionaries store data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs using a hashing mechanism. Each key is unique, and its corresponding value can be accessed efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Sets are used when you need unique elements and faster membership testing. They do not allow duplicates and provide efficient operations like union, intersection, and difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: A string is a sequence of characters and is immutable, meaning it cannot be modified in place. A list is a collection of elements (which can be of different data types) and is mutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Tuples are immutable, which means their contents cannot be changed after creation. This ensures that the data remains consistent and prevents accidental modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. Dictionaries in Python use hash tables internally to provide fast lookups and store key-value pairs efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can lists contain different data types in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Yes, lists can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, floats, and even other lists or objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Explain why strings are immutable in Python.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Strings are immutable in Python to improve performance and security. Immutability ensures that strings can be shared and cached without risk of unintended modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Dictionaries allow fast access to data using keys, making them ideal for tasks involving lookups, mappings, or associative arrays. Lists require linear searches, which are less efficient for such operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Tuples are preferable when you need to store a collection of constants or when you need to use the collection as a key in a dictionary because tuples are hashable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Sets automatically discard duplicate values, ensuring that all elements in a set are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How does the \"in\" keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: For lists, the 'in' keyword checks for the presence of a value. For dictionaries, it checks for the presence of a key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple because tuples are immutable. Any attempt to change a tuple's content results in an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: A nested dictionary is a dictionary that contains other dictionaries as values. It can be used to represent hierarchical data, such as a company's organizational structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: The average time complexity for accessing elements in a dictionary is O(1) due to its underlying hash table implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Lists are preferred when you need to maintain order, perform sequential operations, or when you have a collection of values without a specific key-value mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Dictionaries are considered unordered because their elements are stored based on their hash values, not their insertion order. However, starting with Python 3.7, dictionaries maintain insertion order.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Lists retrieve elements by index, which requires numerical indexing. Dictionaries retrieve values by keys, allowing for fast lookups with named keys.\n"
